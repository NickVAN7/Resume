Located in this repository are a few projects that represent my skills as a programmer. 


First, a project I completed during my Foundations of Algorithms class at Johns Hopkins. It is a iPython notebook analyzing the RSA Cryptography Algorithm. There are two files, the first 'VanRensselaer_ProjectReport.ipynb' is the final report that was submitted. It fully analyzes the RSA Algorithm, its complexity, and its implementation. It includes the full algorithm code and an explaination of the code. The second file, 'VanRensselaer_RSA_Full Code.ipynb' is the fully documented implementation code that I used to test and prove the complexity of the RSA Algorithm. 

The Second project, I completed during my Object-Oriented Programming in C++ class. The objective of the project was to create a Virtual Poker Game. In order to do this, I had to correctly use the priciples of Object Oriented Programming. To prove that these priciples were used, the 'main()' method is only 4 lines of code. The project is able to take bets, deal a hand, analyze the hand, calculate winngings, and complete the game of Poker. Note: It is not perfect code, there are still a few bugs that need to be worked out.
